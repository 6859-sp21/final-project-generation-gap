# Bridging the Generational Gap

## Overview

Polarization in U.S politics has been growing in recent years. The “generation gap” between youth and older adults in American society reflects these widening divisions in political viewpoints and media consumption. Even within a family, these gaps between parents and children have the opportunity to cause conflicts and create communication siloes. With our scrollytelly visualization “Bridging the Generational Gap”, we attempt to find common ground in both the news different generations have lived through and the news sources they consume. Using media trend data from Pew Research and headlines from AllSides.com, we also highlight the various media biases and political leanings of many news sources. Our final unit visualization encourages people to learn from others by allowing users to choose from various demographics to build a real reader, step into their perspective, and explore their newsfeed. Though division has become a defining feature of American Politics, our goal is to create a story with interactive visualizations to help each side talk with and understand one another.

## Development Process

### Pre-MVP
We started off by independently exploring various datasets before coming together and sharing our findings. After a few iterations of this, we chose a dataset we were the most passionate about-- titanic dataset! Next, we brainstormed what features we wanted to include and how we wanted to tell the story. We designed and styled the scrollytelling and final visualization together to have a cohesive idea of the overall visualization. 

### Post-MVP

## Work Split

Jessica worked on the scrollytelling aspect of the visualization, primarily focusing on using D3 to render the grid and filter for different demographics. She also worked on styling.

Shirley worked mainly on the final unit visualization, focusing on the two graphic displays, transitions, and implementation and styling of filters. I also helped out with styling and transitions of the first part of the scrolly telly. 

Annie worked on preprocessing the data, the timeline interaction at the beginning of the scrolly telly, overall styling and themes, adding the music and the crash audio, and filtering for different demographics of the final visualization.
